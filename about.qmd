Welcome to my blog!

My name is Gianluca — but you can call me Luca!

I'm the Director of Machine Learning at Ontra.ai, where I lead a team of highly talented Machine Learning researchers and engineers working on NLP, Information Retrieval, and recommendations for legal documents. This includes in-house data labeling, neural network training, the science of making it work, and deployment in a production environment serving millions of requests every day.

Before that, I was the Senior Machine Learning Manager at Farfetch, the largest luxury fashion marketplace in the world. My team was working on product recommendations, real-time bidding, predictive modeling, and other fun things :-)

I've been passionate about Machine Learning since 2013 when I first came across Machine Learning as a field at my first job after college at Struq — later acquired by Quantcast. At Struq/Quantcast, we built a real-time bidding engine and a recommendation engine powering millions of personalized retargeting ads daily and had to respond with incredibly low latency. Fun times :-)

Along this journey, I've been lucky to meet some fantastic people and learn a lot from them. I'm passionate about ML/DL and software engineering, and, as you can see from my GitHub profile, I work on many side projects whenever I have time.

This blog is a space for me to explain some exciting ML concepts and share some of my research and experience. The best way to learn something is to teach it to someone else; a blog is an excellent way to accomplish that.

I hope you enjoy the content and share your comments and feedback.

Best,

Luca
