Yet another blog about AI/ML :-)

Welcome to my blog!

My name is Gianluca â€” although my friends call me Luca!

I've been passionate about Machine Learning since 2013, when I first came across it at my first job after college in a digital advertising company. After starting as a Campaign Analyst, I was lucky enough to join the Machine Learning team and got hooked in. Since then, I've been on a journey to learn more about AI and ML. 

Along this journey I've been lucky enough to meet some fantastic people and learning a lot from them. 

This is blog is meant to be a space for me to explain some interesting ML concepts and share some of my own research. I believe the best way of learning something is to teach it to someone else, and a blog is a good way to accomplish that.

I hope you enjoy my writing and share your comments and feedback. 

Best,

Luca
