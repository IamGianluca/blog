    "## Jujutsu - My workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Jujutsu is a relatively new version control tool that is very ergonomic and flexible. The main challenge I found is that both the official documentation and tutorials are very confusing regarding the recommended workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this brief post, I will show you the workflow I use. I hope this can be useful to you in getting started with `jj`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Initialize a new jj repository that shares storage with git\n",
    "# --colocate means jj and git will work on the same repository\n",
    "$ jj git init --colocate\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set up a local bookmark to track the remote main branch\n",
    "# This creates a local \"main\" bookmark that follows \"main@origin\"\n",
    "$ jj bookmark track main@origin\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To sync your local repo with the remote, and rebase:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Fetch the latest changes from all remote repositories\n",
    "# Updates remote-tracking bookmarks like main@origin\n",
    "$ jj git fetch\n",
    "\n",
    "# Rebase current commit and its ancestors onto the main bookmark\n",
    "# This moves your work on top of the latest main branch\n",
    "$ jj rebase -d main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Start working on a new feature branching off from the `main` bookmark/branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Create a new commit on top of main bookmark with a descriptive message\n",
    "# The new commit becomes your current working commit (@)\n",
    "$ jj new main -m \"implement features x and y\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Make all your changes in this one commit\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a new bookmark called \"feature-branch\" pointing to current commit\n",
    "# -r @ means \"at revision @\" (the current commit)\n",
    "$ jj bookmark create feature-branch -r @\n",
    "\n",
    "# Push the feature-branch bookmark and its commits to the remote repository\n",
    "# This creates the branch on the remote for pull request creation\n",
    "$ jj git push --bookmark feature-branch\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above will create a new branch in your GitHub repository. You can use that to create a Pull Request.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, at times you need to work on a large feature, which you might want to break down into smaller changes that you can roll back if needed. Here's how you can do that:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Create a new working commit on top of main bookmark\n",
    "$ jj new main\n",
    "\n",
    "# Make some changes\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a new commit with the changes and move to it\n",
    "$ jj new -m \"add feature x\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Implement feature x\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create another new commit for the next feature\n",
    "$ jj new -m \"add feature y\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Implement feature y\n",
    "\n",
    "# Squash all commits after main into the current commit (@)\n",
    "# This combines \"add feature x\" and \"add feature y\" into one commit\n",
    "$ jj squash --from 'main..' --into @\n",
    "\n",
    "# Update commit message\n",
    "$ jj describe -m \"new message\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a bookmark called \"feature-branch\" pointing to current commit\n",
    "$ jj bookmark create feature-branch -r @\n",
    "\n",
    "# Push the feature-branch bookmark to the remote repository\n",
    "$ jj git push --bookmark feature-branch\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if you're working on a personal repository where you have direct push access to main, you can skip the pull request workflow entirely:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Rebase your feature branch onto main\n",
    "$ jj rebase -d main -s feature-branch\n",
    "\n",
    "# Move main bookmark to include your changes\n",
    "$ jj bookmark set main -r feature-branch\n",
    "\n",
    "# Push to remote\n",
    "$ jj git push --bookmark main\n",
    "```"
